## 🌍 Slide 2 — Why AI Governance Matters
> **"The governance gap is now the biggest risk in AI adoption."**

Governments rushed to deploy AI — but few built the institutions to govern it.

**AI moves fast. Policy doesn’t.**

### ⚡ The Gap
- The *hype cycle* of AI peaks faster than policy cycles.
- Public agencies often adopt AI tools before defining oversight.
- Result: uncertainty, risk, and lost trust.

### 📈 Visual Cue

🟣 Hype → 🚀 Early pilots → ⚖️ Regulatory Lag → 🧭 Governance alignment

## 🧭 Slide 3 — Strategic Layer: Vision & Planning
> “Without vision, AI becomes automation without direction.”

AI governance begins with a clear sense of purpose — linking innovation to **public value**.

### 🔭 Key Strategic Dimensions
1. **Vision & Coordination** — national AI strategies, cross-agency alignment  
2. **Capacity Building** — training digital public servants  
3. **Investment Alignment** — linking funding to measurable outcomes  

### 🌍 Reference Cases
🇪🇺 **European Union** — AI Act as umbrella framework  
🇫🇮 **Finland** — National AI4Citizens plan  
🇪🇪 **Estonia** — early AI governance by design

## ⚙️ Slide 4 — Operational Layer: Capabilities & Procurement
> “Procurement is where AI ethics meet bureaucracy.”

Turning principles into practice requires operational muscle.

### 🧩 Policy-to-Practice Pipeline
**Strategy → Procurement → Implementation → Evaluation**

![Operational Flow](assets/procurement_flow.svg)

- Data readiness and interoperability  
- Responsible procurement guidelines  
- Evaluation & auditing cycles  

### 🇨🇦 🇪🇺 🇺🇸 Comparative Insights
| Country | Strength | Limitation |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Canada** | Early directive on automated decision-making | Weak enforcement |
| **EU** | Unified framework for high-risk AI | Slow implementation |
| **USA** | Fast innovation culture | Fragmented oversight |

---

## ⚖️ Slide 5 — Ethical Layer: Transparency & Accountability
> “Ethics are not a constraint — they are the foundation of legitimacy.”

Ethical AI in the public sector ensures legitimacy, trust, and fairness.

### ⚖️ Core Principles
- **Fairness:** avoid systemic bias  
- **Transparency:** explainability and traceability  
- **Accountability:** human-in-the-loop governance

### 🧭 Implementation Tools
- Algorithmic impact assessments  
- Open audit logs and traceability dashboards  
- Citizen oversight mechanisms

## 🌐 Slide 6 — Latin American Outlook
> “Latin America can leapfrog — not by copying, but by co-creating.”

A region of contrasts: limited resources, high creativity.

### 🇧🇷 🇨🇴 🇨🇱 Regional Highlights
| Country | Initiative | Note |
|----------|-------------|------|
| **Brazil** | National AI Strategy (EBIA) | Focus on public value |
| **Colombia** | GovDigital / ESAP innovation | Institutional capacity building |
| **Chile** | Open data & civic innovation labs | Early ethical frameworks |

### 🔍 Challenges vs. Opportunities
| Challenges | Opportunities |
|-------------|----------------|
| Digital divide | Regional cooperation |
| Weak oversight | Citizen participation |
| Low capacity | Shared data infrastructure |

## 🧩 Slide 7 — From Hype to Sustainable Policy
> “Governance is not a law — it’s a learning system.”

The journey from hype to policy is about **maturity** and **alignment**.

### 🔄 Integration Model
**Strategic + Operational + Ethical → Sustainable Public Value**

![AI Governance Venn Diagram](assets/venn_sustainable_value.svg)

### 🧠 3 Key Takeaways
1. Build **institutional capacity** before technological capacity.  
2. Regulate through **principles**, not panic.  
3. Treat **AI governance** as continuous learning, not a one-off law.  

### ✨ Closing
**From technological hype to sustainable public policy.**
