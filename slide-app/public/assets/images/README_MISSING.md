# Missing Image

**File needed:** `global_local_snapshot.png`

**Purpose:** Visualization showing gaps between EU research focus and Latin American realities for Slide 5 (Gaps & Opportunities)

**Temporary solution:** The slide will still display without this image. You can:
1. Create a custom visualization showing the gap analysis
2. Use one of the existing visualizations as a placeholder
3. Add it later before the presentation

**Suggested content for visualization:**
- Comparison chart showing EU research topics vs. LATAM priorities
- Geographic map highlighting research coverage gaps
- Infographic showing the 5 gap areas (Latin American context, Agricultural AI, Informal economy, Spanish language AI, Global South perspective)
