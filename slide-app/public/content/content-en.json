However, the speed of its adoption exceeds institutional capacity to regulate, evaluate, and ensure alignment with the public interest. This conference proposes a critical journey from hype to public policy, exploring how States can govern AI from three dimensions: strategic (vision and planning), operational (capabilities and public procurement), and ethical (transparency, accountability, and equity). Drawing from international and Latin American experiences, guidelines for responsible and sustainable AI governance in the public sector will be presented.",
