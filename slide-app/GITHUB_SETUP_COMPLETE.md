## How to Test

### 1. Test Locally
```bash
# Stop current dev server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 - it should now load content from GitHub!

### 2. Check Browser Console
Open DevTools (F12) and look for:
```
Content loaded from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosdenner-videns/presentation-content/master/content-en.json
```

## Important Notes

### Cache Considerations
- GitHub raw content has a ~5 minute cache
- If changes don't appear immediately, wait a few minutes
- Or add a version parameter: `?v=2` to force refresh

### Repository Structure
```
presentation-content/
├── content-en.json  (18 KB)
├── content-es.json  (20 KB)
├── content-pt.json  (19 KB)
└── content-fr.json  (20 KB)
```

### Build for Production
When you're ready to deploy:
```bash
npm run build
```

The built app will load content from GitHub (no content in the bundle!).

## Advantages You Now Have

✅ **Update content without rebuilding app**
- Edit JSON on GitHub
- Changes reflect immediately
- No need to redeploy the app

✅ **Version control for content**

## Next Steps

### To Deploy the App

1. **Build the app:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy `dist/` folder to:**
   - GitHub Pages (recommended)
   - Netlify
   - Vercel
   - Any static hosting

3. **That's it!**
   - App loads content from GitHub
   - Update content anytime without redeploying

### To Switch Back to Local Content

If you ever want to use local content again:

1. Edit `.env`:
   ```bash
   VITE_CONTENT_BASE_URL=
   ```

2. Rebuild:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Content Not Loading?

**Check 1:** Verify the URL is correct
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosdenner-videns/presentation-content/master/content-en.json
```

**Check 2:** Make sure repository is public

**Check 3:** Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Changes Not Showing?

**Wait 5 minutes** - GitHub caches raw content

Or add version to `.env`:
```bash
VITE_CONTENT_BASE_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosdenner-videns/presentation-content/master?v=2
```
