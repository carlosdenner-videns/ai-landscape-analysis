# Slide Management Features

## Overview
The presentation app now includes comprehensive slide management capabilities:
- **Persistent Slide Reordering** - Drag and drop slides with changes saved to localStorage
- **Slide Deletion** - Remove slides you don't need for a specific presentation
- **Content Editing** - Edit bullet points directly in the presentation
- **Reset Functionality** - Restore original slide order and content

All changes are persisted per language in localStorage, so your customizations are maintained across sessions.

## Technical Implementation

### Data Storage

All customizations use browser `localStorage` with language-specific keys:

```javascript
// Slide order and deletions
slideOrder_en = {
  order: ["seg-1", "seg-2", "seg-3", ...],
  deletedIds: ["seg-5", "seg-7"]
}

// Content edits
slideContent_en = {
  "seg-2": {
    bullets: ["Updated bullet 1", "Updated bullet 2", ...]
  },
  "seg-3": {
    bullets: ["Modified content", ...]
  }
}
```

### Component Architecture

**New Components:**
- `EditableBullets.tsx` - Handles bullet point editing UI

**Modified Components:**
- `ProgressBar.tsx` - Added delete buttons and hover states
- `SlideDeck.tsx` - Added persistence logic and handlers
- `Slide.tsx` - Integrated EditableBullets component

**Key Functions:**
- `handleReorder()` - Reorders slides and saves to localStorage
- `handleDelete()` - Removes slide and updates storage
- `handleUpdateBullets()` - Saves content edits to localStorage
- `handleReset()` - Clears all customizations
- `saveToStorage()` - Persists slide order and deletions

### Loading Sequence

When the app loads or language changes:
1. Load original segments from JSON
2. Apply content edits from `slideContent_{language}`
3. Filter out deleted slides from `slideOrder_{language}`
4. Reorder segments based on saved order
5. Render the customized presentation
