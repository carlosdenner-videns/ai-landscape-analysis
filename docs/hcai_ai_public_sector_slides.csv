1,119th HCAI Note,"chatbot UX, governance, risks, verification",Hook: “The ethics board never had a second meeting.” 🪑💨,"It’s a wide-ranging and compelling description of the conflicting motivations of key figures — “The people who were most afraid of the risks of artificial intelligence decided they should be the ones to build it. • I was unsettled by their assumption that AI has a mind and agenda of its own, which appears in sentences such as: “They believed that A.I. • bots might do things their creators had not intended.” There is little attention to the human roles or responsibility in finding a cure for cancer or controlling AI bots. • could find a cure for cancer or solve climate change, but they worried that A.I. • An alternative framing … would clarify that AI is a result of human design decisions. • These decisions produce diverse outcomes, for which the developers are responsible.",Design for human control with explicit oversight and audit. • Align with NIST AI RMF; manage risks across the lifecycle. • Reject mystifying metaphors; assign responsibility and liability.,https://mail.google.com/mail/#all/18e118214ce223bc,2024-03-05T21:05:19-05:00,18e118214ce223bc
2,118th HCAI Note,"economics, governance, risks, verification",Hook: Martian robots still need humans with joysticks.,"Aneesh Raman & Maria Flynn in the NYT argue: “A.I. • could usher in a world of work anchored more, not less, around human ability.” I wish they made stronger cases about human abilities and institutional responsibilities. • Finally: Mars Rovers again illustrate how human operators seize unpredicted opportunities and handle failures — human control leads to safer, more reliable systems. • Areas include human insight about AI-produced output and oversight in real‑world environments.","Design for human control with explicit oversight and audit. • Align with NIST AI RMF; manage risks across the lifecycle. • Center human capabilities; use AI to augment, not replace. • Reject mystifying metaphors; assign responsibility and liability.",https://mail.google.com/mail/#all/18dca0c0cad095f8,2024-02-21T00:03:21-05:00,18dca0c0cad095f8
3,116th HCAI Note,"chatbot UX, economics, governance, risks","Community replies on supertools, social reasoning, human nudging, and STS guardrails; webinar link.","• Stuart Reeves (Nottingham): AI researchers often ignore language and common‑sense reasoning in action. • • Sean Koon (Kaiser): opportunity to nudge people toward better ethical reasoning and values — not because AI thinks better, but because it can prompt humans in‑task. • • Bert Painter (STS Roundtable): AGI without HCAI guardrails will serve a few; history of socio‑technical systems shows human guardrails improve reliability and outcomes. • Video: “Linking STS Organization Design and HCAI” now online. • Points to Erik Vinkhuyzen’s series on self‑driving cars; highlights incommensurability between machine reasoning and social reasoning.","Center human capabilities; use AI to augment, not replace. • Reject mystifying metaphors; assign responsibility and liability.",https://mail.google.com/mail/#all/18c464d68d6b4d26,2023-12-07T17:02:04-05:00,18c464d68d6b4d26
